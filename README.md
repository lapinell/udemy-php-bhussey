# My First PHP Dynamic Webiste

This project is a part of Brian Hussey's Practical PHP: Master the Basics and Code Dynamic Websites course on (Udemy)[https://www.udemy.com/code-dynamic-websites/]. 

## Course Review & Thoughts

This was a relatively simple course that covered a good chunk of the super-basics of PHP. It covered many ideas and developing skills that I had already covered in JavaScript making it a rather quick learning experience. Completing the final project probably was the most helpful part of the entire course. It help me see how PHP is utilized to build a more dynamic experience. I was a little bored because of how basic it was, but have no complaints overall.

**Course Plan**

*Section 1 - Introduction*

This section went over what PHP is and provided a shallow explanation about how it works. Then he went over tools, where to find and how to access the course files.

*Section 2 - PHP Basics*

This section went over syntax, variables and constants as well as provided a few exercises.

*Section 3 - PHP Arrays*

Arrays, associative and multi-dimensional, were covered.

*Section 4 - If, Else & Elseif*

If, else and elseif were covered.

*Section 5 - Operators*

The types of operators covered were comparison, logical, arithmetic, string, and assignment

*Section 6 - PHP Loops*

While, For, Foreach and Do / While loops were covered.

*Section 7 - PHP Functions*

Built-in and custom functions were covered as well as simple arguments.

*Section 8 - Coding a Dynmaic PHP Restaurant Website*

This was the most comprehensive part of the course. Starting from scratch, I built a basic webpage layout statically before dividing the page in to php templates starting with the header and the footer. We then moved on to creating the team page which incorporated a team member array, and how to access that from a separate file. We then moved onto the menu page and arrays where we learned about $_GET while building the menu item tempalate. Finally we developed a very simple contact form and incorporated the use of $_POST, simple form validation and submission. He also touched on the use of `preg_match()` to rid ourselves of common code injections.
